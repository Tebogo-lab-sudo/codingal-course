<!--

Producing code: This is the code that performs an operation and either resolves or rejects the Promise depending on the result.

Consuming code: This is the code that waits for the promise to be completed (fulfilled or rejected) and then acts on it.

The Promise constructor takes a function with two parameters: resolve and reject. These are functions provided by JavaScript, and you call them depending on how your asynchronous operation goes.
